# Calculator - Overview

This is my base level attempt at creating a calculator, with 3 different methods. This project was created with JavaScript and React.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It requires [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) to be installed.

    git clone https://github.com/tanmichael1/Calculator.git
    cd calculator
    npm install

## Usage
